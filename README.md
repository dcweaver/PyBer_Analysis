# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
PyBer, a ride sharing company, requested a deep dive into their data. They requested a breakdown of weekly rides by city type (Urban, Suburban, Rural) along with a multi-line graph showing the total fares by week for each type of city. Using the python dependencies pandas and matplotlib, the data was easily filtered, cleaned, and plotted.

##Results
Initially, the two datasets given in .csv format were read into python and merged using the pandas library. Grouping by city type, the summary dataframe containing all the data can be seen below.
